				<p>Frustrated with the quality of free CSS templates online but aren’t quite to the level of building your own? Tired of spending hours trying to customize lame pre-fab designs? </p>
				<p>Today we bring you over seven hundred freely downloadable CSS templates that focus on providing you with only a basic layout to build upon. Using these cross-browser layouts you can avoid endless CSS positioning woes and focus on what you’re good at: design. </p>

				<h2>Who Are These For?</h2>
				<p>Many of you have been in the design game for years but are only now just beginning to create websites and code them by hand. You’ve got enough Photoshop skills to bust out a beautiful design and enough basic CSS knowledge to make the text look pretty. </p>
				<p>However, the biggest problem that many new developers come across can simply be to get their basic layout to work in CSS. Positioning with CSS can be a lot trickier than basic styling, especially when you start to factor in multiple browsers. If you’re not sure about how to solve a problem, hours of tweaking can land you right back where you started, immensely frustrated and desperate for a little help. </p>
				<p>The simple downloadable layouts below will provide you with a rock solid foundation on which to build your sites and provide great examples for learning how to create your own. </p>
				<h2>Why Not Full Templates?</h2>
				<p>If you run a quick Google search for free CSS templates, you’ll find a million. However, most of these aren’t ideal for real web developers setting out to create unique sites. What you typically get is something like this: </p>
				<div class="tutorialimage"><img class="alignNone size-full wp-image-1611" src="http://designshack.designshack.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/ds-freelayouts-12.jpg" alt="screenshot" width="510"></div>
				<p>Templates like this really force you in an ugly pre-established design that you either have to follow or spend hours pulling apart to try and customize. In the end it would’ve been easier just to code it yourself from scratch!</p>
				<p>I think it’s much more useful to download a few super basic CSS layouts that are as simple as possible. This allows you to quickly prototype the layout for a page without wasting half your day sorting through code you don’t need. The typical layout in this category looks more like this:</p>
